# shellgAIde

Deterministic, GNU-first shell scripting toolchain inspired by the Google Shell Style Guide, designed for AI-assisted script generation/refactoring + strict validation.

## TL;DR

```bash
make setup
make shell
make ci

# CI runners:
make ci-only
```

## What is this?

shellgAIde standardizes:
- GNU userland (especially on macOS)
- ShellCheck + shfmt + structure rules
- a toolchain shell that makes the environment obvious

For full documentation (commands, AI prompt usage, validation workflow), see the repository README.
