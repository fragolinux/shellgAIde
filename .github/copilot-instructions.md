# Copilot repository instructions

This repository ships its canonical system prompt in `PROMPT_SYSTEM.md`.

**Recommended:** copy/paste the full content of `PROMPT_SYSTEM.md` into this file so Copilot Chat applies it automatically.

If you keep this file as a pointer, make sure to attach `PROMPT_SYSTEM.md` explicitly when prompting Copilot.
